		    	<p>We are group of individual traders based in Cleckhuddesfax who decided to establish an e-commerce platform that would sell locally produced goods and make it available for the local residents who cannot buy at the opening hour so we have decided to extend the opening hour time for the locals and to do so we decided to develop a prototype E-commerce website.<br><br>

				A small area of one of the shop where the order could be collected by the residents at three time slot according to their choice which must be after 24	hour after the order. Our aim is to help the local residents since they could visit the site through their phone or laptops which makes it convenient for the users to place order even if they are at work.</p> <br>

				<p>Our cutomers can get high quality locally produced goods all at one specific location whether it be	bakery item, vegetable etc. which will be available for the residents in opening hours as well as extended opening hours and collect their goods at their preferred time slot. We have 5 traders which are fishmonger, butcher, greengrocer, bakery and delicatessen they specialise in locally sourced high quality goods which are growing in popularity but cannot be purchased through local supermarkets.</p>
